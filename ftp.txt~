Step One—Install vsftpd

	You can quickly install vsftpd on your virtual private server in the command line:

		sudo apt-get install vsftpd

	Once the file finishes downloading, the VSFTP will be on your droplet. Generally speaking, it is already configured with a reasonable amount of security. However, it does provide access on your VPS to anonymous users.

Step Two—Configure vsftpd

	Once vsftpd is installed, you can adjust the configuration.

	Open up the configuration file:

	sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf

	The biggest change you need to make is to switch the Anonymous_enable from YES to NO:

	anonymous_enable=NO

	Prior to this change, vsftpd allowed anonymous, unidentified users to access the server's files. This is useful if you are seeking to distribute information widely, but may be considered a serious security issue in most other cases.

	After that, uncomment the local_enable option, changing it to yes and, additionally, allow the user to write to the directory.

	local_enable=YES

	write_enable=YES

	Finish up by uncommenting command to chroot_local_user. When this line is set to Yes, all the local users will be jailed within their chroot and will be denied access to any other part of the server.

	chroot_local_user=YES

	Save and Exit that file.
