1. Install the DHCP server by typing the following command in terminal-
		sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server

2. After installing the DHCP server we need to make changes to the following configuration files-

	a)  First open the isc-dhcp-server file which is located in 
				/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server.
   		After that add the interfaces to which you want to run the DHCP server, for ethernet which we use eth0.
		You can always check for the interface you want to apply by opening the network manager.

	b) After this open the dhcpd.conf which is  located in 
				/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
	   Now you have to define lease time ( default and max lease time ) optional  domain name and domain name servers , the range of IP addresses that you want DHCP server to assign to hosts, the network address, the subnet mask etc.
	   HINT: Look for something like: "A slightly different configuration for an internal subnet"
		subnet: 192.168.1.0 netmask: 255.255.255.0 {
			range 192.168.1.20 192.168.1.30
			option domain-name-servers server.unixmen.local;
			option domain-name "unixmen.local";
			option routers 192.168.1.1;
			option bradcast-address 192.168.1.255;
			default-lease-time 60;
			max-lease-time 60;
		}

4. After making changes to the configuration files , save them and start the DHCP server by typing the command-
				sudo service isc-dhcp-server start

After this connect to the client via ethernet cable.
Make sure that the network settings are selected to DHCP at the client's site.
Now type the command ifconfig at terminal at client's site.
You will notice that the ip assigned to client is in between the range we defined for the DHCP server.
You can check for the exact process running at the background by checking system log file.
