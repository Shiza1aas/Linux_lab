First of all we need to install nasm. 
We can get this at 

http://viralpatel.net/taj/tutorial/hello_world_bootloader.php

Now we will write our own bootloader in assembly language.

For helloworld, we need to write the following code.

[BITS 16]	;Tells the assembler that its a 16 bit code
[ORG 0x7C00]	;Origin, tell the assembler that where the code will
				;be in memory after it is been loaded

MOV SI, HelloString ;Store string pointer to SI
CALL PrintString	;Call print string procedure
JMP $ 		;Infinite loop, hang it here.


PrintCharacter:	;Procedure to print character on screen
	;Assume that ASCII value is in register AL
MOV AH, 0x0E	;Tell BIOS that we need to print one charater on screen.
MOV BH, 0x00	;Page no.
MOV BL, 0x07	;Text attribute 0x07 is lightgrey font on black background

INT 0x10	;Call video interrupt
RET		;Return to calling procedure



PrintString:	;Procedure to print string on screen
	;Assume that string starting pointer is in register SI

next_character:	;Lable to fetch next character from string
MOV AL, [SI]	;Get a byte from string and store in AL register
INC SI		;Increment SI pointer
OR AL, AL	;Check if value in AL is zero (end of string)
JZ exit_function ;If end then return
CALL PrintCharacter ;Else print the character which is in AL register
JMP next_character	;Fetch next character from string
exit_function:	;End label
RET		;Return from procedure


;Data
HelloString db 'Hello World', 0	;HelloWorld string ending with 0

TIMES 510 - ($ - $$) db 0	;Fill the rest of sector with 0
DW 0xAA55			;Add boot signature at the end of bootloader


Now we will save it using .asm extension.

To compile it:

nasm ourbootloader.asm -f bin -o boot.bin


Now to copy to disk, we would simply run the following command.

dd if=boot.bin bs=512 of=/dev/fd0 ; in linux

where /dev/fd0 is the inserted disk location.

Congrats saif you did this.


For installing rpm on ubuntu, you need to install "alien"

sudo apt-get install alien dpkg-dev debhelper build-essential


To convert a package from rpm to debian format, use this command syntax. The sudo may not be necessary, but we’ll include it just in case.

    sudo alien packagename.rpm

To install the package, you’ll use the dpkg utility, which is the internal package management tool behind debian and Ubuntu.

    sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb

The package should now be installed, providing it’s compatible with your system.
